# Maruti Suzuki - Cloned Website

This is a clone of the Maruti Suzuki website that I built as part of a project. It includes the HTML, CSS, and images necessary to replicate the main features of the Suzuki India website.

## Features
- Fully responsive design.
- Interactive and styled navigation bar.
- Displaying various Suzuki cars and information.
- Contact and footer sections with external links and WhatsApp integration.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the website here: [GitHub Pages - Maruti Suzuki Clone](https://muhammedshihab1001.github.io/Maruti-Suzuki/)

## Installation

To run this website locally, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammedshihab1001/Maruti-Suzuki.git
